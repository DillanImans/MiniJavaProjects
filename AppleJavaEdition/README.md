Objective:
Make an Apple Store where the customer can choose what to buy, and what additional features they want to buy.
<br/>
I do recommend running my code so you can see what's going on. Make something similar to that.
<br/>
Also, this whole project is to practice OOP, so be sure to use OOP (classes, inheritance, etc)
<br/>
<br/>
Example:
Welcome to Apple!
<br/>
What do you want to buy?
<br/>
1 for Macbook
<br/>
2 for Iphone
<br/>
3 for Airpods
<br/>
0 for Exit
<br/>
(if user enters 1)
<br/>
Model (Air|Pro)
<br/>
Color (Gold|Silver)
<br/>
...
<br/>
Total cost: $X (dependent on the user's choices)
