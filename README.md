# Mini Java Projects
Had a Java lab course on my first year of university. The professor gave me a couple of assignments to do to practice the syntax. I thought it'd be nice to upload everything to my github incase anyone wants to try to make their own version of the projects I made. For every mini-project, I'll write the objectives on what you need to make in a README file in their respective directories. Goodluck!

From easiest to hardest:
- Addition quiz 
- Compound interest calculator
- Gradual weekly savings
- Dice rolling statistics
- Apple Store (Java Edition) [slightly bigger project | first oop-based project]
-
